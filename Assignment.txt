Store and Query JSON Data in MongoDB

Goal:
    Explore NoSQL by storing and querying semi-structured sales data in MongoDB.
Tasks:
    Store order data as nested JSON documents (customer, product, region).
    Run queries to:
        Retrieve all orders in a given date range.
        Group sales by region or category using the aggregation pipeline.
        Compare flexibility vs. relational SQL model.

Tech: MongoDB, Python (PyMongo)

Deliverables: .ipynb or .py with CRUD + aggregation examples + screenshots (Mongo shell/Compass query outputs)
